# ECommerceBackend

# <h3>Description<h3>

To demonstrate my ability to build a backend database with API routes for RESTful CRUD Operations. To also demonstrate my ability to test my routes using Insomnia. 
The backend is for an e-commerce site. With this updated code I can assure that the website uses the latest technologies so that it is competitive with other sites. 
I have learned alot about database modeling and backend routing.
